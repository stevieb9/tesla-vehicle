=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution provides methods for accessing and updating aspects of your
Tesla vehicle. Not all attributes available through Tesla's API have methods
listed here yet, but more will be added as time goes on.

To access attributes that we don't have methods for, see the
L</AGGREGATE DATA METHODS> section, pull that data, then extract out the info
you want. If we don't have an aggregate data method for something you want yet,
see L<Tesla::API> to be able to get this yourself.

As always, requests for updates to my software is encouraged. Please just open
an L<issue|https://github.com/stevieb9/tesla-vehicle/issues>.

=head1 IMPORTANT

The parent module L<Tesla::API> that we inherit the Tesla API access code from
has a complex caching mechanism in place that you ought to know about. Please do
read through the L<Tesla API Caching|Tesla::API/API CACHING> documentation.

=head1 OBJECT MANAGEMENT METHODS

=head2 new(%params)

Instantiates and returns a new L<Tesla::Vehicle> object. We subclass L<Tesla::API>
so there are several things inherited.

B<Parameters>:

All parameters are sent in as a hash. See the documentation for L<Tesla::API>
for further parameters that can be sent into this method.

    id

I<Optional, Integer>: The ID of the vehicle you want to associate this object
with. Most methods require this to be set. You can send it in after
instantiation by using the C<id()> method. If you don't know what the ID is,
you can instantiate the object, and dump the returned hashref from a call to
C<list()>.

As a last case resort, we will try to figure out the ID by ourselves. If we
can't, and no ID has been set, methods that require an ID will C<croak()>.

    auto_wake

I<Optional, Bool>: If set, we will automatically wake up your vehicle on calls
that require the car to be in an online state to retrieve data (via a call to
C<wake()>). If not set and the car is asleep, we will print a warning and exit.
You can set this after instantiation by a call to C<auto_wake()>.

I<Default>: False.

    api_cache_time

I<Optional, Integer>: The number of seconds to cache data returned from Tesla's
API.

I<Default>: 2

    warn

Enables or disables the warnings that we receive from Tesla if there's a failure
to execute one of the L</COMMAND METHODS>.

If enabled, we print these warnings to C<STDOUT>.

I<Optional, Bool>: True (C<1>) to enable, false (C<0>) to disable the warnings.

I<Default>: True

=head2 auto_wake($bool)

require it online, and the vehicle is currently offline.

Send in a true value to allow us to do this.

I<Default>: False

=head2 warn($bool)

Enables or disables the warnings that we receive from Tesla if there's a failure
to execute one of the L</COMMAND METHODS>.

If enabled, we print these warnings to C<STDOUT>.

B<Parameters>:

    $bool

I<Optional, Bool>: True (C<1>) to enable, false (C<0>) to disable the warnings.

I<Default>: True

=head1 VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION METHODS

=head2 id($id)

Sets/gets your primary vehicle ID. If set, we will use this in all API calls
that require it.

B<Parameters>:

    $id

I<Optional, Integer>: The vehicle ID you want to use in all API calls that require
one. This can be set as a parameter in C<new()>. If you attempt an API call that
requires and ID and one isn't set, we C<croak()>.

If you only have a single Tesla vehicle registered under your account, we will
set C<id()> to that ID when you instantiate the object.

You can also have this auto-populated in C<new()> by sending it in with the
C<< id => $id >> parameter.

If you don't know the ID of the vehicle you want to use, make a call to
C<list()>, and it will return a hash reference where each key is a vehice ID, and
the value is the name you've assigned your vehicle.

=head2 name

Returns the name you associated with your vehicle under your Tesla account.

B<NOTE>:L</id($id)> must have already been set, either through the C<id()>
method, or in C<new()>.

=head2 list

Returns a hash reference of your listed vehicles. The key is the vehicle ID,
and the value is the name you've assigned to that vehicle.

Example:

    {
        1234567891011 => "Dream machine",
        1234567891012 => "Steve's Model S",
    }

=head1 VEHICLE SUMMARY METHODS

=head2 in_service

Returns a bool whether your vehicle is in service mode or not.

=head2 options

B<NOTE>: The Tesla API, since 2019, has been returning wrong information about
vehicle option codes, so do not trust them. For my Model X, I'm getting
returned option codes for a Model 3. Several people I've spoken to about the
issue see the same thing for their Model S.

Returns a hash reference of the options available on your vehicle. The key is
the option code, and the value is the option description.

    {
        'APH3' => 'Autopilot 2.5 Hardware',
        'RENA' => 'Region: North America',
        'MR31' => 'Uplevel Mirrors',
        'GLFR' => 'Final Assembly Fremont',
    }

=head2 vehicle_id

Returns an integer of Tesla's representation of the vehicle identification of
your vehicle. This is not the same as the ID you use to access the API.

=head2 vin

Returns an alpha-numeric string that contains the actual Vehicle Identification
Number of your vehicle. This value is located on a stamped plate on the driver's
side bottom on the outside of your windshield.

=head1 VEHICLE LOCATION METHODS

Alongside L</latitude> and L</longitude>, we provide a convenience method to
return human readable address location data for your vehicle.

=head2 address

Takes no parameters. If the L</latitude> and L</longitude> information for the
vehicle is available, we will return a hash reference containing the street
address information of the vehicle.

The geocode translation is done through the
L<Nominatim Geocode API|https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Reverse>.

It uses Open Street Map to gather its information.

The return hash reference may have additional keys depending on the specific
location.

Example return:

    {
        'state'             => 'British Columbia',
        'city'              => 'Kelowna',
        'road'              => 'Old Vernon Road',
        'postcode'          => 'V1X 7T8',
        'village'           => 'Ellison',
        'country'           => 'Canada',
        'ISO3166-2-lvl4'    => 'CA-BC',
        'leisure'           => 'Ellison Dog Park',
        'country_code'      => 'ca',
        'county'            => 'Regional District of Central Okanagan'
    }

=head1 COMMAND METHODS

All command methods return a true value (C<1>) if the operation was successful,
and a false value (C<0>) if the command failed.

We will also print to C<STDOUT> the reason for the failure if one occurred.
This warning includes the message we received from Tesla.

You can disable these warnings from being displayed by sending in a false value
to C<warn()>, or instantiate the object with C<< new(warn => 0) >>.

Example warning:

    $vehicle->media_volume_up;

    # Output

    Couldn't turn volume up: 'user_not_present'

=head2 bioweapon_mode_toggle

Returns true if the operation was successful, and false if not.

You must give time for the trunk to shut before checking its status with the
C<trunk_front()> call.

=head2 wake

Attempt to wake the vehicle up from sleep mode. Most method calls against this
object require the vehicle to be awake.

We don't return anything; the vehicle will be woken up, or it won't and your
next method call will fail.

By default, this software does not wake up the car automatically, it just
C<croak>s if the car isn't awake and you attempt something it can't do while
sleeping.

Set C<< auto_wake => 1 >> in C<new()> or C<auto_wake(1)> to allow us to
automatically wake the vehicle up.

=head1 AGGREGATE DATA METHODS

These methods aggregate all attributes of the vehicle that relate to a specific
aspect of the vehicle. Methods that allow access to individual attributes of
these larger aggregates are listed below. For example, C<charge_state()> will
return the C<battery_level> attribute, but so will C<battery_level()>. By using
the aggregate method, you'll have to fish that attribute out yourself.

=head2 data

Returns a hash reference containing all available API data that Tesla provides
for your vehicles.

C<croak()>s if you haven't specified a vehicle ID through C<new()> or C<id()>,
and we weren't able to figure one out automatically.

This data will be retained and re-used for a period of two (C<2>) seconds to
reduce API calls through the Tesla API. This timing can be overridden in the
C<new()> method by specifying the C<< refresh => $seconds >> parameter, or by
a call to the object's C<delay($seconds)> method.

I<Return>: Hash reference. Contains every attribute Tesla has available through
their API for their vehicles.

The data accessor methods listed below use this data, simply selecting out
individual parts of it.
